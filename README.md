# Housing Market Visualization Tool

HomeScope is an website designed to support users in their housing decisions by providing real-time data and insights into rental and purchasing options. The platform caters to relocators, first-time homebuyers or renters, and real estate agents by offering wide search capabilities, interactive maps, and crime/demographic statistics within a user-friendly interface.

The primary goal of HomeScope is to streamline the housing search process and promote informed decision-making through the platform's enhanced accessibility of market information. 
Using updated data from the housing market, neighborhood demographics, and mapping, we aim to create a seamless user experience that will help you find your future home or neighborhood.
